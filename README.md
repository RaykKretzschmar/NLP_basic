# NLP PROJECT AT FSU Jena SS2023

This was a project of the Natural Language Processing Course at the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena. \
The goal is to identify causal relationships between different phrases. \
The task was splitted into three subtasks. \
After classifying which sentences contain causal relationships (sentence_classification), a identification of the phrases which relate to another (span_extraction) was necessary. \
Lastly we needed to classify in which direction the phrases relate (relation_classification). \
The whole pipeline that combines all steps is found in relation_extraction.ipynb
